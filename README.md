A modern workout tracking web application built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Leaflet.js**.

This project was developed as a **portfolio application** to deepen my understanding of frontend architecture, object-oriented programming, state management, and browser APIs by building a complete interactive single-page application without frameworks.

## Why I Built This

The goal of this project was to move beyond simple DOM manipulation and build a real-world single-page application with a structured architecture, state management, and persistent data handling — using only Vanilla JavaScript.

I focused on:

- Object-Oriented Programming (inheritance, encapsulation)
- Managing complex application state manually
- Handling multiple UI modes in a predictable way
- Working with browser APIs (Geolocation, LocalStorage)
- Building interactive map-based experiences

## Application Flow
User interacts with the map
↓
Workout or route is created
↓
Workout object is instantiated
↓
UI updates (list + markers)
↓
Data saved to LocalStorage

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was managing multiple UI states (Normal, Draw, Edit) while keeping the application predictable and maintainable.

To solve this, I implemented:

- A centralized state system inside the `App` class
- A UI mode indicator (visual feedback for current state)
- Clear separation between persistent and transient states
- Cleanup functions to reset UI between modes

Another challenge was synchronizing multiple layers of the application:

- Map markers
- Workout list
- Drawn routes
- Persistent storage (LocalStorage)

## Future Improvements

- Refactor into ES Modules (cleaner architecture)
- Backend integration (Node.js / Firebase)
- User authentication system
- Workout analytics dashboard
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Mobile-first UI improvements
- Search functionality for workouts
